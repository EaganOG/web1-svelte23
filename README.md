# Health Care Clinic Web Project

This is a website written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript that has been designed as a simple and streamlined website that could be used by many people for their own domains. This site was build using SvelteKit ([https://kit.svelte.dev]) which is a framework that streamlines building apps by using file based routing. I used this framework because it helps you create simple, and straight forward components that allow you to reduce the number of times you will have to repeat code.<br><br>There were some challenges though, after learning base Javascript, some of the Svelte syntax can be more difficult to get used to. As well as that, getting started with SvelteKit I found, as a new user to the codeline base to be quite difficult, so later on I will write a comprehensive guide to installing Sveltekit.
